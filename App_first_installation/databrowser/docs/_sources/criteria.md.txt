### How to manage data criteria

By clicking on the **Criteria** button in the visualization window, a page opens where users can manage what information will be shown in data visualization. 
For each dimension the system will show available values in a hierarchical way (if a hierarchy is defined) and the user can select the values to filter. 
By clicking on **Apply** the system will retrieve data according to the filters set, and just the result set will be shown to the end users.
The set query must return at most the maximum number of observations (configurable at single node level), beyond which the user will be asked to set more restrictive conditions.

Example #1:

Example #2:

![other criteria](_images/criteria2.PNG)

A particular focus can be set on the visualization of **time_period**, especially on its ordering and how it is managed. If data has multiple frequencies such as:

```eval_rst
 .. image:: _images/multifreq1.PNG
    :scale: 80 %
    :alt: multi_freq
```

the output table as default, will return the time_period ordered in a "hierarchical" way. Considering the previous example, starting from the the first month available, in order, quarters, semesters and year will follow, as shown in this image:

```eval_rst
 .. image:: _images/multifreq2.PNG
    :scale: 80 %
    :alt: multi_freq2
```

It is also possible to select the range for time_period choosing between the minimun and the maximum date present in the data table.

Or in some cases, if time can be separated in periods, user can choose the period to visualize

If a default is defined in node configuration or in dataflow annotation the text box will be set with this value.

The authenticated user can select "Full range" to not apply filters on the time dimension. This option is useful if a view is present and data is update with new periods.
If "Full range" has been chosen to build the view this will be updated with new periods otherwise the view will have just periods selected as custom range or last periods. 
The "Full range" option is not available for anonymous users as they cannot build views.
