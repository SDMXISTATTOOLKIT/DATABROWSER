## How to browse different data providers

The landing page shows information about default node (if set). From the landing page the user can choose to browse a different node by selecting the data providers in the section **Other nodes** both by clicking on the images or the descriptions.

Another way of reaching a different node from the default one, is by selecting the node from the top left menu of the page and choosing from the pop-up list.

Once the node is clicked, the Public Statistics Hub will show the node's homepage including: information, data grouped by categories and dashboards.

From a node's homepage it is possible to browse a different data provider by clicking again on the top left menu and selecting a different node from the list.

The "Home" icon will always be visible in the header of the application so the user can always easily return to the node's homepage.
