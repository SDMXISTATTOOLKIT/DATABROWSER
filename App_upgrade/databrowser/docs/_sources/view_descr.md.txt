## What is a view

Views can be described as visualization at user level that, once saved, they can be accessed again in other moments as long as the user doesnâ€™t decide to delete them.
The user modifies criteria and/or layout and saves his choices, so that when he reopens the saved view, the output will show the settings he previously configured for the table.
