### How to add a bookmark

![Bookmark](_images/bookmark.png "Bookmark")

When we have finished visualizing the data for a given dataflow, you can keep track of this navigation by adding a bookmark using the button at the bottom of the visualization itself.
If, for example, you are viewing data from the "Population" dataflow, adding a bookmark will take that name.

The bookmark will always be present even when other data are opened, so clicking on it will always take you back to the last view you made on "Population".
Once the browser is closed the saved bookmarks are all deleted.
